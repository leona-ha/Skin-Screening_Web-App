# Skin-Check: A deep-learning based Web-Application for Skin Cancer Detection

Skin Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, with increasing incidence. In Germany, it makes up one third of all cancer diagnoses (https://www.tk.de/techniker/gesundheit-und-medizin/praevention-und-frueherkennung/hautkrebs-fruehererkennung/hautkrebs-wie-hoch-ist-das-risiko-2015296). While Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent type of skin cancer, Melanoma is considered the most dangerous one. In both cases, however, early diagnosis is crucial to facilitate successfull treatment.

Since lesions occur on the surface of the skin, visual detection via dermatoscopy (an imaging technique that enables visualisation of deeper skin levels by removing surface reflection) is the best practice. With the widespread availability of high resolution cameras and even smartphone devices for skin monitoring (e.g. https://dermlite.com/products/dermlite-hud), research on automated analysis is growing. As an important step in the development of automated diagnostics, the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is hosting challenges on automatic skin lesion analysis since 2016, providing the world's largest repository of standardized, publicly available dermatoscopic images.
